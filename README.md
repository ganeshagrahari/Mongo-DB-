## üìñ Introduction
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications using flexible, schema-less collections. In this journey, I aim to gain proficiency in:
- CRUD Operations
- Data Modeling
- Indexing
- Aggregation Framework
- Replication and Sharding

This repository contains my notes, scripts, and projects to demonstrate my learning progress.
